## Rental Net

This is small project about website to renting movies.
To run the project correctly:<br/>
 -delete '.example' from all files.<br/>
 -type npm start in 'frontend' and 'api' folder<br/>
 -that's all!

PostScriptum: I'm learning in this same time, so some files may be changed to better version in the future.
